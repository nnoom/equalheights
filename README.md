# Simple jQuery Equal Heights Object

This was a "scratch my own itch" type of thing.

## How To Use It

The functions take two parameters that are both required.
- The container which holds the items you'd like to equalize.
- The items within the container that need equalizing.

Call it like any normal JS object, and pass in the parameters. They can be class names, IDs, elements, whatever.
